#####Install
Drag `wavesui` folder into `tf/custom`

#####Install the fonts
Navigate to `resources/fonts`, select all (Ctrl+A), right click, install

#####Custom crosshairs
There are a bunch of crosshairs in `hudlayout - xhairs.res` that can be enabled by setting `visible` to `0`.

I prefer using weapon specific crosshairs that can be set in the corresponding .txt in the scripts folder.
(heres a thread that teaches you how to do it.)
